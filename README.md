# ALX_BE-Capstone-project
Movie Review API: A backend service developed with Django and Django REST Framework to manage user-generated movie reviews. The API provides the following core functionalities:

* Adding new reviews for movies.
* Updating existing reviews.
* Deleting reviews.
* Viewing individual reviews and lists of reviews.

This project aims to replicate a real-world development environment, requiring skills in database interaction, RESTful API design, and potentially extending to authentication and deployment of the API.
